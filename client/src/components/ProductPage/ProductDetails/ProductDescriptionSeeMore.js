      <p className="sub_heading">The True Strength of Whey</p>
      <p className="first_description">
        Whey Protein Isolates (WPIs) are the purest form of whey protein that
        currently exists. WPIs are costly to use, but rate among the best
        proteins that money can buy. That’s why they’re the first ingredient you
        read on the Gold Standard 100% Whey label. By using WPI as the primary
        ingredient along with premium ultra-filtered whey protein concentrate
        (WPC), we’re able to pack 24 grams of muscle-building protein into every
        serving. ON’s attention to detail also extends to mixability. This super
        quality powder has been instantized to mix easily using a shaker cup or
        just a glass and spoon. There’s no doubt that this is the standard by
        which all other whey proteins are measured.

      <p className="sub_heading">Suggested Use</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spoon Stirred:</strong> Gold Standard 100% Whey is instantized.
        That means if you forgot your shaker cup or don’t have time to get out
        the blender, just add one rounded scoop of Gold Standard 100% Whey to a
        glass filled with 6-8 oz of water or your favorite beverage. Then mix it
        up with a spoon. Stir for 30 seconds or until powder is completely
        dissolved.
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Adjust the taste for your Gold Standard 100% Whey
        by varying the amount of liquid that you use to prepare it. For a bolder
        flavor with slightly more body and sweetness, mix each scoop with 4-6 oz
        of water, milk, or your favorite beverage. For a milder tasting, less
        sweet shake, use 8-10 oz of liquid per scoop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Suggested Use:</strong> Consume enough protein to meet your
        daily protein requirements through a combination of high protein foods
        and protein supplements. For the best results, consume your daily
        protein allotment over several small meals spread evenly throughout the
        day.
